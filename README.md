# Summer Web 2018
The repository for IECSE's Summer Web 2018

## Some basic instructions before we get started

* Create a new branch of the form `<first name> "-" <last name>` using the command `git checkout -b <branch name>` to create and shift to your own branch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example- `git checkout -b aritra-basu`
* All commits must be descriptive of what has been committed to the branch currently, use the convention `task # : desciption`.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example- `Task 1 : Added new route give reply`
* after every major change to your code perform the following steps
	* `git pull origin <branch name>` should not be required as you will be working individually on your own branches, but do it anyway. 
	* `git add .` this adds all your work to the staging area.
	* `git commit -m "message" `   creates a local commit of your changes.
	* `git push origin <branch name>` makes the changes permanent on the remote repo.
* All solutions will be pushed to the master branch.
